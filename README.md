## Project Structure

- **output**: This directory is for keeping the detected new images. Used by the `createBoundingBox` method in `detector.py` file
- **trained_model**: After testing against Faster and Mask R-CNN, finally,Faster R-CNN which is generated by the downloader from TF Object Detection Model Zoo
- **scripts**: A directory created & defined by the developers to keep useful scripts for making the developement of this project as seamless as possible
- **src**: Holds the `python` codes
- **test**: It is used to store the existing and real time `image` and `videos` which are used by the `main.py` file for training the model.
